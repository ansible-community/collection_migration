## Aim

Incomplete scenario that migrates most things into placeholder collection, hopefully leaving a usable Ansible version, keeps certain things in Core.

This is *NOT *for final/production use.

## How to test

`ansible-minimal` is built, at least daily, to https://github.com/ansible-collection-migration/ansible-minimal and is installable by doing:

`pip install git+https://github.com/ansible-collection-migration/ansible-minimal.git`
